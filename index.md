title: About Jan
---

I'm currently a Robotics Research Engineer at [Dyson](https://www.dyson.co.uk).
My research interests are in real-time vision algorithms and applications, such as 3D reconstruction for virtual/augmented reality and robotic perception. 

Outside of research I like to brew beer, ride bikes and enjoy the outdoors with my wife, Connie, and our cocker spaniel.

My beer brewing hobby has become way too serious and has now evolved into a mini side business: [Barking Spaniel Brewery](https://www.barkingspanielbrewery.co.uk).
