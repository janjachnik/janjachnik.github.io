When I accidentally damaged one of my new Hunt carbon bike wheels and had the rim replaced on insurance, I knew I couldn't just throw the old rim away. Something about matt-black carbon just looks awesome and I immediately knew it would make an excellent clock.

The original wheel had 20 spokes which I thought might make reading the time consfusing, so I opted for an 8 spoke design chopping the face into quarter-hour segments. I also added some rings from a rear cassette for extra bike-ness.

I'm really pleased with the minimal design:

I designed and 3D printed the central hub that mounts the clock mechanism and gears and it includes the 8 spoke holes required to mount it into the rim. The whole thing is then just hung by a piece of string looped around the valve stem.

I also somehow managed to find some matt-black hands that fit the size of the rim perfectly.
