When I accidentally damaged one of my new [Hunt](https://www.huntbikewheels.com) carbon bike wheels I had the rim replaced on insurance. Now I had a structurally damaged but visually immaculate carbon rim that needed a new purpose, so the carbon aero clock was born.

The original wheel had 20 spokes which I thought might make reading the time consfusing, so I opted for an 8 spoke design chopping the face into quarter-hour segments. I also added some rings from a rear cassette for extra bike-ness.

I'm really pleased with the minimal design:

The central hub is 3D printed, mounts the clock mechanism and gears, and includes 8 spoke holes required to mount it into the rim. 

Enhanced aerodynamics and wind-tunnel testing don't seem to make time go any faser, though.
