I have finally got around to setting up a new website and blog. I hope to keep it up to date with whatever I'm working on, be it research or brewing related (or anything else).

Part of the reason I finally got this website running was the discovery of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). I seem to be fond of minimalist at the moment and the static pages generated by Jekyll along with [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll), the minimalist theme I forked, have given me a site I'm much more happy with than my previous attempts with PHP and WordPress. Free hosting from Github is a bonus. You can find the source [here](https://github.com/janjachnik/janjachnik.github.io).
