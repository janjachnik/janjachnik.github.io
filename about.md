I'm a final-year PhD student in the [Robot Vision Group](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/robotvision/) at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk). My research interests are in real-time vision algorithms and applications, such as 3D reconstruction for virtual/augmented reality and robotic perception. Outside of research I like to brew beer, wakeboard and enjoy the outdoors with my fianc&eacute;e, Connie, and our cocker spaniel, Cookie.
