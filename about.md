I'm currently a Robotics Research Engineer at [Dyson](https://www.dyson.co.uk).
In my spare time I'm finishing writing my PhD thesis in Robot Vison from [Imperial College](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/robotvision/). 
My research interests are in real-time vision algorithms and applications, such as 3D reconstruction for virtual/augmented reality and robotic perception. Outside of research I like to brew beer, wakeboard and enjoy the outdoors with my wife, Connie, and our cocker spaniel, Cookie.
